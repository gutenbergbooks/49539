<h2><a name="AIR_AND_WATER_POLLUTION" id="AIR_AND_WATER_POLLUTION">AIR AND WATER POLLUTION.</a></h2>


<p><span class="smcap">We</span> have been lately staying at a pleasant sea-side
resort. The stretch of sands on the beach is beautiful,
the houses generally well built and commodious,
the accommodation for strangers excellent.
With much to commend, one thing struck us as
very anomalous. There are several factories,
including one or two bottle-works, and from these
are almost constantly sent forth huge volumes
of dense black smoke, which according to the
direction of the wind, pour across the otherwise
fair scene, and tend greatly to pollute the atmosphere.
Now, this we presume to think is a serious
encroachment on public rights. Nature beneficently
provides a pure atmosphere, which all may
enjoy, and that will be favourable to vegetable
growth. Despising this primary principle, and
acting only from sheer selfishness, certain individuals,
ordinarily known as capitalists, set up factories
with tall brick chimneys, from which are
vomited those hideously dark masses of coal-smoke,
in defiance of good taste, decency, and common-sense.
We had almost said in defiance of honesty,
because the air of heaven is a universal inheritance,
and the pollution of it for selfish ends is,
morally speaking, little better than picking a
pocket. Yet, how much of this aggressive dishonesty
is habitually practised! The air of towns
and villages is polluted. Some of the most beautiful
rural scenes are polluted. Over charming
dells, clothed in natural shrubbery and flowers,
to which one would like to flee and be at rest, is
seen hovering a pall of black smoke, projected from
some sort of factory or a paper-mill, and doing its
best to transform beauty into ugliness. Surely,
to speak mildly, that is a public wrong.</p>

<p>Travelling through England, and entering what
are termed the manufacturing districts, we come
upon the Smoke Demon in full blast. Who, for
example, can forget the revolting aspect presented
by Sheffield or Wigan? The sky hidden by dark
smoke, the houses begrimed, and the land blighted,
as if saturated with coal-culm. Obviously, there
is a prevailing sootiness; and speculating as to how
people can possibly live amidst such horrors, we
think with a feeling of relief of the joy they possibly
experience when on Sunday the chimneys
cease to smoke, the blue firmament is suffered to
be unveiled, and children are able to fill their lungs
with air comparatively free from impurity. Even
in the neighbourhood of towns not absolutely of
the manufacturing class, the tourist is pained to
observe what atmospheric deteriorations are caused
by smoke. In few places nowadays are there not
tokens of industry involving the application of
steam-power. Tall chimneys are apt to start up
where least expected, with the usual results.
These brick chimneys are not usually an embellishment
to the landscape; but we raise no objection
to them on this ground. Required for
purposes of manufacture, and valuable in connection
with the employment of large numbers
of persons, they may be viewed as indispensable
adjuncts in promoting commercial prosperity,
and increasing the national wealth. Accordingly,
it is not the chimney-stalks we find fault with;
it is the vast masses of smoke that needlessly
issues from them, which at a very small expense
and a slight degree of care, could be effectually
prevented. For want of this reasonable
amount of care, the green fields in the vicinity of
the chimneys cease to be green. The soot falling
on the pasturage, defiles the herbage; and the
poor sheep and lambs, born to experience the
vicissitudes of weather, but at least to wear clean
wool upon their backs, are as dingy as professional
chimney-sweeps. Unmistakably, they have been
besmirched by the Smoke Demon, who in his
iniquitous visitations respects neither man nor
beast, and is apparently indifferent to what
becomes of the whole animal and vegetable creation.
Perish the comfort of everybody; let smoke
in any measure of density have its sway! That is
the doctrine of greed predominant in this wonderfully
advanced nineteenth century, which some
people are never done eulogising.</p>

<p>We see a curious instance of the Smoke Demon's
proceedings in a reputedly fashionable part of a
large city. A piece of land had just been laid out<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_514" id="Page_514">{514}</a></span>
in the building of mansions of a superior class&mdash;not
one of them valued at less than seven or eight
thousand pounds&mdash;when lo and behold the purchasers
of the newly erected edifices find to their
consternation that the tall chimney of an unexpected
factory has begun to belch volumes of black
smoke into their back-windows all day long! The
chimney&mdash;that of a perfectly respectable flour-mill,
we believe&mdash;is unexceptionable as regards chimney
architecture. It is tall and handsomely tapered;
but what signifies these commendable qualities?
There, from morning to night, goes its smoke, polluting
the atmosphere in the bedrooms, killing
the flowers in the conservatories, odious and sickening
in all directions. Very hard this on the
purchasers of these splendid mansions. They have
got unexceptionably good houses, but with what an
atmospheric drawback!</p>

<p>Why, however, should municipal authorities
tolerate such abominations? Yes, why should
they? There exist in many places police edicts
designed to quench the Smoke Demon. Through
the vigilance of the authorities, the smoke nuisance
in London has been immensely modified within
our recollection. In some large provincial towns
it has likewise been materially abated. But taking
the country at large, it is about as bad as ever.
The evil has little chance of being thoroughly
mastered by any local magistracy. The very
authorities who should stamp out the abomination
are likely enough to be the evil-doers themselves,
or are at least so compromised by surrounding
influences as purposely in this particular to neglect
the interests of the community. Besides, to put
existing and not very distinct laws in motion, a
heavy expense is liable to be incurred. And local
authorities of all kinds do not like to encounter
litigation unless strongly urged by public clamour
and backed by persons of note, who do not mind to
take trouble and share part of the cost. We
apprehend that no effectual remedy is obtainable
in present circumstances.</p>

<p>The true corrective would be to assign the conservancy
of the atmosphere and of rivers to officers
directly appointed by and responsible to the crown.
To this opinion has come Dr Richardson, one of
the most eminent promulgators of the laws of
health. In a recent lecture on the subject at the
Royal Institution, he says very pointedly: 'In
the future of sanitary science, the politician must
come forward more resolutely than he has done,
in order to secure for those he governs three requisites&mdash;pure
water, pure food, and pure air. It is
utterly hopeless to trust to companies in a matter
of such vital importance as the supply of water.
It is equally hopeless to trust to the undirected
action of local authorities.' Proceeding to state
that a remedy can be found only in the official
action of a supreme authority, he says: 'As to
pure air, there is no practical legislation of
any kind. The air of our large towns is charged
with smoke and impurity. The air of our great
factories is charged with dusts which destroy life
with the precision of a deadly aim. Dr Purdon,
one of the certifying surgeons under the Factory
Acts, reports that in flax-working factories under
his care, the carders, who are all females, if they
get a carding-machine at sixteen years, generally
die at thirty years. Could anything be more terrible
than such a fact, that a girl of sixteen should
have to live by an occupation that will bring her
existence to an end in fourteen years, and to that
end with all the prolonged wasting, sleeplessness,
suffering, incident to the disease consumption of
the lungs? If it were the fate of these doomed
workers that at the close of fourteen years' work
the majority of them were taken forth and shot
dead in an instant, their fate were infinitely better
than it is. The heart of the nation would thus be
aroused, and the law in all its majesty would be
put in operation to arrest the progress of the crime
and to punish the offenders. Yet, year after year
as terrible an offence goes on, and because the result
of it is hidden in the sick-room, there is no arrest
of its progress, no punishment for its commission.'</p>

<p>In the same lecture, Dr Richardson speaks with
equal vehemence on the too prevalent practice of
polluting rivers and wells by the influx of sewage
from large towns and various kinds of public
works, dye-works in particular. Here, again, the
action of local authorities is generally hopeless.
Magistrates and town councils will complacently
see a river flowing past them loaded with impurities.
'The government,' he says, 'must either
produce a process or processes for pure water
supply, and insist on every local authority carrying
out the proper method; or it must&mdash;and this
would be far better&mdash;take the whole matter into
its own hands, so that under its supreme direction
every living centre should, without fail, receive
the first necessity of healthy life in the condition
fitted for the necessities of all who live. By recent
legislation we had some security for obtaining fresh
animal food, and foods freed of foreign substances
or adulterations. The penalties that might be
inflicted on those who sell decomposing, diseased,
or adulterated foods were beginning to have effect,
and much good was resulting.' Similar regulations
ought to be applied to water. The fouling of
rivers by sewage must be rendered penal. What
horrid ideas arise on the consideration that a
large part of the population of London are daily
using the water of the Thames, into which has
been poured the sewage of Oxford and a number of
other places! The Clyde below Glasgow offers an
example of still greater pollution; but its very
badness saves it from use for domestic purposes;
and in point of fact this fine river, for the improved
navigation of which so much has been done, can
now scarcely be spoken of as anything else than a
gigantic common sewer, on which ships of large
burden are borne to and from the sea. The Irwell
at Manchester offers a specimen of an impure river
of a different type. Here much of the pollution
seems to arise from the liquid refuse of dye and
other works. The last time we saw the Irwell, it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_515" id="Page_515">{515}</a></span>
had all the appearance of a sluggish river of black
ink. Its colour, however, is liable to change with the
predominating dye-stuffs which it happens to receive.
The droll remark is made, that boys who
indiscreetly take a fancy for bathing in it are apt to
come out blue. Its condition and qualities were
some time ago commemorated in a few comic verses
in a newspaper, of which a cutting was sent to
us. We give them as being too clever to be lost
sight of.</p>

<span class="i2">And here and there a sewer.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">By fetid bank, impure and rank,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">I swirl, a loathsome river;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For men may write, and men may talk,<br /></span>

</div></div>

<p>We trust that the concluding threat of remaining
for ever a poisonous and fetid river is not true of
the Irwell any more than the Thames or the Clyde.
The subject of river-pollution, as of air-pollution,
is too serious to be much longer neglected, and we
trust that government, setting aside private, selfish,
and factious interests, will soon deal with it in as
peremptory a fashion as constitutional forms will
admit. As concerns the pollution of the air by
smoke from factories, there is not a vestige of
excuse. We have shewn again and again with, we
fear, tiresome reiteration, that the consumption of
smoke is a very simple mechanical process, and has
the advantage not only of keeping the air unpolluted,
but is attended with such a considerable
saving of fuel, as to render the first cost of the
appliances of no consequence. If such be the
case, and we can prove it by many years' experience,
the proprietors of public works at the sea-side
resort already mentioned, and hundreds of
other factory owners, are clearly chargeable with
a shameful degree of disregard to the rights and
feelings of their fellow-creatures.</p>

<h2><a name="THE_LAST_OF_THE_HADDONS" id="THE_LAST_OF_THE_HADDONS">THE LAST OF THE HADDONS.</a></h2>

<p class='ph3'>CHAPTER XXXVII.&mdash;REST AND PEACE.</p>


<p><span class="smcap">Time</span> has run on since then, and my life has
grown fuller and happier. It was a great disappointment
to Philip and Lilian to find what my
boasted good fortune really was; and nothing
would reconcile them to the idea of my remaining
at the Home, although they were not able to deny
that the work there was congenial to me.</p>

<p>Marian Trafford never forgave me my one day's
grandeur, and never again addressed me as an
equal when we chanced to meet. She and her
husband did not lead the happiest of wedded lives.
On the evening of Lilian's wedding-day, Arthur
Trafford was found lying on the floor of his dressing-room
with an exploded pistol by his side. If
he really meant to destroy himself, he had attempted
it in the half-hearted way with which he
did everything, having only grazed his temples
and swooned with fright, and so offended his wife
to no purpose. Poor Marian, her married life was
neither a long one nor a happy one! No child's
voice was heard at Fairview; and the miserable
bickerings between the husband and wife were
common gossip. She was not the kind of woman
to try to conceal her disappointment; and he was
not the kind of man to spare her the knowledge
that she had never possessed his love. Could he
have foreseen, he would doubtlessly have adopted
a different policy, and at anyrate kept up some
semblance of affection.</p>

<p>A neglected cold and improper clothing for the
season brought on an attack of inflammation of the
lungs, to which Marian succumbed; and after her
death it was found that she had avenged herself.
A lawyer was hastily summoned to her bedside,
and her will made as soon as her illness was pronounced
dangerous. After the funeral it was
found that the endeavours of Arthur and his sister
to make up for the past by extra attention at the
last had been in vain. It was said that she talked
to them about the large fortune which they would
inherit up to almost the last hour; and their disappointment
was bitter in proportion.</p>

<p>All Marian Trafford's wealth was left to Lilian's
children. Not to Lilian, as she in a characteristic
letter informed her&mdash;'In case your husband should
die, and Arthur should get the property after all,
for he would be sure to marry you directly. Many
and many a time has he taunted me about his
love for you; and as good as said I wasn't to be
compared! But if he married me for the sake
of my money, he won't have much to boast of
now. His sister too, Caroline, will be in a fine
state; but she's only got herself to thank for
what I have done. I <i>did</i> mean to leave something
handsome to Caroline, till I overheard her
talking to her brother about me begging him to
have patience a little while longer, because the
doctors said that I could not last out many days
unless a turn came; and saying ever such things
about what she had had to put up with! What
she had to put up with, indeed! When she has
had such a home at Fairview, and lived upon the
best of everything, without its costing her a penny!<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_516" id="Page_516">{516}</a></span>
And as to presents; no one could be more generous
than I have been to Caroline; and she knows it,
if she would only speak the truth. If I do not
get over it, I am determined that <i>they</i> shan't be
any the better off! I'd sooner leave everything
to Miss Haddon, though I should be loath to do
that too. Fortunately, there is you, dear; you
are my sister after all, and your Ma was not
treated well; I have always said that. Besides,
I can't forget how kind you were to me, when
you thought that it was <i>my</i> Ma who went wrong
instead of yours. You never shewed off a bit;
and it's only right you should be rewarded. I
haven't put Aunt Pratt into my will, because one
naturally does not care about its being known that
any of one's relations are common people; but I
should like you to give something handsome to
her, and say it came from me;' and so forth, and
so forth; a letter we were all only too glad to
put out of sight and out of mind as soon as
possible.</p>

<p>The Pratts were well taken care of, and not a
little astonished at Marian's liberality, as it was
interpreted to them by Lilian. Arthur Trafford
made a great deal of protestation in the outset
about his repugnance to receiving the annuity
which Philip offered; but of course he <i>did</i> receive
it, and in time came to think that it was much
less than he ought to have, always forestalling it.
But Philip remained firm, and never increased
the amount to more than was at first offered, a sum
which he considered sufficient for an idle man to
live upon.</p>

<p>How shall I write of the married life of Philip
and Lilian? I will only say with the poet:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Love took up the glass of Time, and turned it in his glowing hands;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Every moment lightly shaken ran itself in golden sands.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>They were not selfish in their happiness, finding
plenty of room in their hearts for those outside
their own circle; which by the way was now a
not very small one. Need I say they held fast to
'Sister Mary;' and though they could not be
brought to allow that she had chosen the life she
was best fitted for, they did their best to impart
to it as much sunshine as they could; and I hope
comforted themselves with the belief that my
happiness was owing more to their efforts than my
work. Was there a word of truth spoken in the
jest, sometimes thrown playfully at me, to the
effect that I was imbuing my god-child Mary with
the notion that she had a mission, as her brothers
term it? She was a thoughtful earnest child of
fifteen, who had spent a great deal of her time
with me, and sometimes said she would choose
Aunt Mary's life before all others. It did her no
harm to think so for the time being; but I knew
that Aunt Mary would choose her mission to be
a happy wife and mother. Failing that, I could
only hope she would be as happy as Aunt Mary.
For notwithstanding an occasional bit of sentiment,
I was as happy a woman as could be found
in the three kingdoms, with a larger circle of
friends than I could well count. And very proud
I was of their friendship, though the majority of
them could not be said to belong to the upper
strata of society. I had a large correspondence too&mdash;letters
which brought tears of joy and thankfulness
to my eyes, though they could not be quoted
as elegant specimens of the art of letter-writing;
to say nothing of their being addressed in a somewhat
eccentric manner, occasionally sealed with a
thimble, and so forth.</p>

<p>I imagined that the story of my life would run
thus smoothly and evenly on to the end; but the
aspect of things changed. First, we lost dear old
Mrs Tipper, who passed peacefully away, lovingly
tended in her last moments by her children, as
she called us. She left everything she possessed
to me. Shortly afterwards, Jane Osborne died,
bequeathing the bulk of her property for the
future maintenance of the Home, and what she
termed a competence to me. Five hundred a year
appeared to me something more than a competence;
and with my dear old friend's legacy it made me
a rich woman.</p>

<p>Philip and Lilian would now give me no peace,
insisting that I had not the shadow of an excuse
for remaining at the Home. Moreover, Hill Side
was waiting for me. They had been long engaged
in altering and improving Fairview, and had at
length taken up their abode there. It was now a
large estate, sufficient ground adjoining having been
purchased to make a good park; and the trees,
planted fifteen years before, were beginning to look
respectable. The house itself has been a great deal
altered and <i>subdued</i>, as Philip calls it, a story
being taken away, and wings thrown out, &amp;c.;
very greatly to its improvement. It now looks a
fitting home for a family of good standing, and as
Philip's brother allows, a residence worthy of one
who owns the name of Dallas.</p>

<p>In truth they had outgrown Hill Side; two
spirited boys and three girls with the necessary
arrangements for an education befitting their accumulating
wealth, were not contemplated in the
first plans; and I could not pretend to think that
the change had been made solely on my account;
although they threatened to let the place fall to
ruin, if I would not go to it. Everything was left
just as it was; Lilian took nothing but her mother's
portrait, and Philip a portion only of his books;
and to this also there was no demurring; Fairview
being furnished befitting its size. Whilst I
was still hesitating, or fancied that I was hesitating
(for I found it very pleasant to dwell upon the
idea of ending my days at Hill Side), Robert
Wentworth put in an irresistible argument in
favour of my yielding to their wishes, and
quitting the Home. He pointed out that I was
preventing some poor gentlewoman from earning
the income pertaining to the situation. I was not
a little surprised at his going over to their side;
but, I could not, had I wished to do so, deny
the reasonableness of his argument. As soon,
therefore, as a lady was found to undertake the
office, I resigned it.</p>

<p>My home-coming was made a fÃªte-day in the
village. Had a royal visitor been expected, more
could not have been done in the way of preparation.
The place was gay with flags and evergreens,
whilst feasting and bell-ringing were going
on all day. And the approach to my future home
was arched over with flowers, and '<span class="smcap">Welcome</span>'
repeated wherever the word could be put, but
expressed more delightfully than all in the faces of
Philip, Lilian, and their children. It was a busy
day too, as 'befitted the coming home of Aunt
Mary,' laughingly said the children. A dinner was
given to the grown-up people in a large tent on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_517" id="Page_517">{517}</a></span>
the green; and later on a tea, to which children
were invited, with a day's holiday to all and sports
between times. Of course Becky and her husband
were honoured guests with their eight children.
He is now a flourishing market-gardener, very proud
of his little woman, though her happy married life
does not tend to decrease the size of her mouth,
since there is always a smile upon her face.</p>

<p>We had all been very busy, and were glad to
take our tea on the terrace in the cool of the evening&mdash;just
sufficiently distant from the sound of
merriment in the village below. After tea, Philip
and Lilian, lovers still, stroll down to the green to
watch the sports awhile, the tired children electing
to remain with Aunt Mary and Uncle Robert. My
eyes followed the two as they passed down the path
under the flowery arches, husband and wife in all
the best sense of the words. Philip was a stately,
thoughtful, English gentleman, growing anxious
and ambitious for his two boys; a little too ambitious,
I told him, in certain directions, since they
are but mortal. And his happy wife, beautiful
'with all the soul's expansion,' was worthy to be
the mother of girls&mdash;confiding to me <i>her</i> ambition
to fit them to influence the lives of honourable men.</p>

<p>My nieces, as they were called, were to live
with me in turn. Lilian says they are very pitiful
to such of their friends as have no Aunt Mary.
Little Phil was very enthusiastically describing to
me the advantages of my new home.</p>

<p>'Look here, Aunt Mary; it's the best place for
larks you can imagine; beats Fairview hollow.'</p>

<p>'Larks, Phil?'</p>

<p>'Well, you know. Suppose you've got some
one in the library you want to make jump nearly
out of his skin; just creep round the plantations,
and crawl under the bushes, and climb up over the
stones&mdash;you must take care though, for they are
awfully slippery&mdash;and peep in at the windows
with your face made up like a brigand, and point
a sham pistol at him!'</p>

<p>I expressed a doubt as to my capacity for crawling
under bushes and climbing over slippery
stones; at which Phil proposed other larks, which
he considered to be more within the compass of
my ability. But with the dignity of thirteen, and
the experience of three months at Eton, Robert
gave it as his opinion that Phil's larks were not
worthy of the name.</p>

<p>'Look here: I know a fellow;' &amp;c. &amp;c.; sinking
his voice into a whisper as the two boys drew
closer together; their sister Jenny, who is said to
be developing a taste for larks, and is very proud
of being occasionally taken into their confidence,
listening with bated breath and dilating eyes.
Then Mary whispers to me that if I want to enjoy
that bit out of <i>Midsummer Night's Dream</i>, and
fancy myself in the woods <i>really</i>, I must sit under
the tree on the slope when the moon is rising and
the shadows are deep. And before she is carried
off by her nurse, Baby Lily solemnly presents me
with a woollen lamb, which she thinks enough to
insure my future happiness and make me 'dood.'</p>

<p>'And so you have got your rest and peace at
last?' said Robert Wentworth, as he and I stood
for a few moments together on the terrace watching
the sunset.</p>

<p>'Yes,' I replied, a little absently, my thoughts
reverting to the old dreams of peace and rest.</p>

<p>'Well, it's all <i>couleur de rose</i> now. But how
long will this kind of thing satisfy you?'</p>

<p>'What kind of thing?'</p>

<p>'Being worshipped and fÃªted in this way.'</p>

<p>'I find it very pleasant,' I demurely replied.</p>

<p>'You will not for long, Mary.'</p>

<p>'Do you think I am not capable of appreciating
rest and peace then?'</p>

<p>He smiled. 'I give you six months.'</p>

<p>'And yet you were as urgent as the rest about
my giving up work,' I said.</p>

<p>'Yes; I wanted to see you in an independent
position, and so to ascertain if certain theories of
mine are correct.'</p>

<p>'Uncle Robert, is it true? Phil says he heard
mamma tell papa that she did not despair of your
marrying Aunt Mary even now. Is it true&mdash;<i>really</i>?'</p>

<p>I saw a swift flush pass over his face, and an
expression in his eyes which I had only once seen
there before, as they turned for a moment upon
me. Then after a few moments he said, in a low
husky voice: 'Ask auntie!'</p>

<p>Robert Wentworth had never married, and I
cannot affect to be ignorant of the cause; but in
all the long years that have passed he has spoken
no word of love to me. Now the child's words
had stirred the depths of his nature, and shewn
me that time has worked no change in him.</p>

<p>'Is it true, auntie&mdash;is it?' asked Jenny, turning
impetuously towards me.</p>

<p>'Uncle Robert and I love each other like
old friends, dearie,' I said, replying <i>to him</i> in a
low faltering voice. 'But&mdash;I am too old to think
of&mdash;marrying;' laying my hand gently upon his,
resting upon the back of a garden-seat, as I spoke.</p>

<p>'Well, that's what Robert and I said,' frankly
ejaculated Jenny. 'You <i>are</i> old, and old people
don't marry;' and off she ran to tell the others.</p>

<p>He recovered first, beginning to talk to me
about a case he had in hand, and very soon contriving
to get me sufficiently interested in it to
enter warmly into the pros and cons with him.
He was no longer a briefless barrister, having
made a name in the profession, and being remunerated
accordingly. I have the comfort of knowing
that his life, like my own, is on the whole a
full and happy one, although we have both had to
bid adieu to certain things.</p>

<p>Before the six months he had given me expired,
I began to find that I required change of air, and
commenced absenting myself occasionally from my
beautiful luxurious home for two or three weeks
at a time and sometimes even longer, much to the
surprise of Philip and Lilian, who could not
understand why I should choose to go alone and
be so mysterious about the places I visited. But
they became less anxious if not less curious when
they found that I always returned cheered and
refreshed by the change, and at length ceased to
question me.</p>

<p>Robert Wentworth appeared to take it for
granted that my trips were in search of the picturesque;
occasionally remarking that I must be
growing familiar with all the loveliest nooks in
England. I flattered myself that I had for once
succeeded in keeping him in the dark, and he did
not suspect the real object of my journeys. But I
was mistaken. I might as well have taken him
into my confidence at once, and he shewed me
that I might, in his own fashion.</p>

<p>During one of my absences from Hill Side, I
was under the unpleasant necessity of appearing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_518" id="Page_518">{518}</a></span>
at a police court. In obedience to a call for Mary
Jones, I stepped into the witness-box, as unwilling
a witness as had ever made her appearance there.
I had just been trying to comfort myself with the
reflection that Robert did not take up such cases,
and was not at all likely to be there, when our
eyes met; and from the amused expression in his,
I knew that he was about to examine me, and
something of what I might expect. As he afterwards
informed me, he had taken up the case for
the express purpose of shewing me that he knew
all about my movements.</p>

<p>'Is Mary Jones your real name?'</p>

<p>'It is the name I am known by.'</p>

<p>'And you are a lodger in Biggs Court, Bethnal
Green?'</p>

<p>'Yes; I have two rooms there.'</p>

<p>'And go out nursing sick people in the neighbourhood?'</p>

<p>'I have occasionally done so.'</p>

<p>'Is it a fact that you have musical evenings
and readings to which you invite the poor women
in the neighbourhood; and that you lend money
to the deserving, and give lectures to them about
the management of their homes and children?'</p>

<p>'I do not call them lectures, sir,' I replied
demurely. 'But I see that you know all about
my movements.'</p>

<p>'It is my business to know,' he replied gravely,
going on with the case, a charge of assault, not
uncommon in the neighbourhood of my town
residence, to which I had been a witness, and was
obliged to give evidence.</p>

<p>Since then we have not met very frequently.
He is always an honoured guest at Fairview; but
he is on the Bench now, devoted to the grand
earnest life of the upright judge, and has very
little time for private intercourse, although he is
always ready to give us counsel and advice. It is
my pride to hear of the respect and honour he
wins, and to know that I have not been instrumental
in impairing his usefulness in the world.
Meantime, we are beginning to talk sometimes of
the life beyond, with the yearning of those who
have borne the heat and burden of the day, and I
listen with bowed head and thankful heart to his
acknowledgment that his life has not been lived in
vain for himself any more than for others. This
may be said only to cheer and comfort me; but I
believe that it is truer than he himself thinks it to
be. But I am above all pleased with his occasional
grim little attacks upon my logic, &amp;c., for
that is to me the most convincing proof that we
are the best of friends; and we are highly amused
when the children take my part, and ask him not
to be hard upon Aunt Mary.</p>

<h2><a name="HYDERABAD_AND_ITS_RULERS" id="HYDERABAD_AND_ITS_RULERS">HYDERABAD AND ITS RULERS.</a></h2>


<p><span class="smcap">The</span> dominions of the Nizam, of which Hyderabad
is the capital, are situated in the southern part of
Central India, and are of considerable extent&mdash;nearly
five hundred miles from north-east to south-west,
and about three hundred and fifty in breadth.
The Nizam holds a very high place among the
native sovereigns of India; his revenue is a large
one, and is yearly increasing, greatly owing to the
wise administration of the present prime-minister,
Sir Salar Jung, a man of singularly intelligent
and enlightened views, with a remarkable capacity
for government. For upwards of twenty years
this able and talented man has powerfully swayed
the councils of the Nizams; and since the death
of the last ruler, his young son and successor,
still a minor, has been entirely under his guidance
and control.</p>

<p>The young Nizam is now a boy of nine or ten
years of age; and until he is fifteen he will not
assume the reins of government. His health is
unfortunately not good; his constitution being
naturally a feeble one, and the enervating life led
in the zenana has in no way tended to strengthen
it. He is said to have an amiable disposition
and not bad abilities; an English tutor has been
provided for him, and he has every facility for
receiving a first-class education. This, in conjunction
with the wise counsels of his prime-minister,
ought to make him a liberal and enlightened
ruler when the time comes for him to take
the authority into his own hands. Let us trust
that it will be so.</p>

<p>Sir Salar Jung speaks English fluently; and on
the not rare occasions when he gives an entertainment
to the Ã©lite of the European society, his
manners are those of a polished and high-bred
gentleman, anxious that his guests should enjoy
themselves, and that none should be overlooked.
In his extensive and splendidly furnished palace
are several rooms fitted up entirely in the English
style, with chairs and sofas of every form and
dimension, and tables covered with albums, photographs,
and all the innumerable ornaments and
knick-knacks of fashionable London drawing-rooms.
Here the guests all assemble before dinner; and
when the announcement is made, Sir Salar offers
his arm to the principal lady present, generally
the wife of the English Resident, and conducts her
to the dining-room, his own private band playing
<i>The Roast Beef of Old England</i>, while the company
defile into their places. Here, again, all is
in the English style, or rather in that which is
known as <i>Ã  la Russe</i>; a long table brilliantly
lighted, and decorated with flowers, fruit, and
confectionery, all arranged in the most tasteful
manner, the band continuing to play at intervals.
The dinner is in precisely the same European
fashion&mdash;one course following the other; and the
viands and wine all of the most <i>recherchÃ©</i> description;
champagne in abundance, liqueurs, everything
in short that can gratify the most fastidious
palate; Sir Salar himself being a man of the
simplest tastes and drinking nothing but cold
water.</p>

<p>Dinner ended, all rise, the gentlemen not remaining
behind the ladies. Sir Salar again conducts
the <i>burra bebee</i>, or principal lady, to a terrace
on the roof of the palace, where there are seats
arranged for the guests, tea and coffee handed
round, a quiet cigar permitted in the background,
and where a fine exhibition of fireworks is witnessed.
This is the conclusion of a very agreeable
entertainment, to which about a couple of hundred
people are usually invited, who are all
received with the most perfect courtesy by Sir
Salar, his young sons, and the members of his
suite; and who quit his hospitable roof much<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_519" id="Page_519">{519}</a></span>
impressed by the large-mindedness and frank
geniality that so greatly distinguish the Nizam's
popular prime-minister.</p>

<p>Sometimes while the company is arriving, a
'nautch' is held in a kind of garden quadrangle,
and the guests stroll out and look on for a few
minutes, just as they feel inclined. Ordinary
nautch-dancing is anything but the incorrect proceeding
it is commonly supposed to be; it is
really rather a dreary entertainment, and a very
few minutes of it will be sufficient to satisfy the
curiosity of most people. Be this as it may,
nautch-dancing is a very favourite amusement
among the high-class natives. When Sir Salar
Jung gives a banquet to his fellow-countrymen,
there is a nautch on a very large scale; the viands
also differ considerably from those presented to
his European guests, and consist chiefly of curries
of every possible kind and flavour, sometimes more
than fifty being served at a meal.</p>

<p>Though he has held the supreme power for
many years, and has been prominently before the
public for a yet longer time, the prime-minister
of the Nizam is not much above forty years of
age. He is of medium height, with an air of great
dignity, an intelligent expression, and piercing
dark eyes. His face is entirely shaven except a
dark moustache; he generally wears a tight-fitting
dark robe and small white turban, with the Star
of India on his breast, and well-fitting English
boots. His two wives and his daughters are never
seen out of the zenana, but they receive visits from
English ladies; and it is generally understood
that Sir Salar is more liberal in his ideas regarding
the treatment of women than is usual among
Mussulmans; and his daughters are well educated,
and have had foreign instructresses.</p>

<p>Among the institutions of Hyderabad evidencing
an enlightened spirit both among the foreign residents
and the natives, is the successful establishment
of an American female doctor, a lady distinguished
alike by professional skill and charm of
manner, and who commands an excellent practice
among the female portion of the community. She
is also frequently summoned to attend at the
zenanas, a very great boon to the poor secluded
inmates, whose maladies are very frequently
wrongly treated, owing to the imperative strictness
of the rule which prohibits the physician from
ever seeing his patient; the most that is allowed
in the case of a male practitioner being the extension
of the hand or tongue through a slit in a
curtain, the face all the time remaining perfectly
invisible.</p>

<p>Hyderabad, with which is closely connected the
large Anglo-Indian station of Secunderabad, is in
many respects a very pleasant residence. The
society is good, for in addition to a considerable
sprinkling of civilians, occupied in various ways,
Secunderabad is an important military centre, and
the district enjoys many advantages in a social and
sanitary point of view. Only about twenty-four
hours' journey from Bombay by rail, it is thus
brought into easy communication with one of the
great mercantile and social centres of India. Its
real distance from Madras is not much more; but
as there is no direct line, a detour has to be made
in order to join the main line from Bombay at
Sholapore, which nearly doubles the time consumed
in travelling between the two places. This,
however, may probably be amended by-and-by;
when Madras will be about equidistant with
Bombay, and Hyderabad will then rise into even
greater importance. The climate is, generally
speaking, excellent: its situation, nearly two
thousand feet above the level of the sea, conducing
much to its salubrity; while it is fortunate
in having two monsoons or rainy seasons, one
between June and September, and a shorter one
later in the year. These rains are not of the
ordinary violent character, but more resemble
April showers; the entire depth of fall not usually
averaging beyond twenty inches, while it is more
genially and beneficially diffused, rendering the
air delightfully cool and pleasant.</p>

<p>The cost of living is perhaps rather under the
recognised rate of most Anglo-Indian stations. Certain
things are to be had very reasonably indeed,
while others are high-priced, especially the generality
of European articles, which are charged
nearly double what they would fetch at home.
Strangely enough, tea is very dear; nothing drinkable
can be got under about six shillings a pound;
lower-priced kinds being perfect trash. But eggs,
poultry, and even very tolerable mutton can be
bought very cheaply; a rupee (about two shillings
of our money) will purchase three or four fowls,
certainly rather skinny ones; while three rupees
is an ordinary price for one of the small country
sheep, and the mutton is not bad, though of course
it is not 'gram-fed,' as they call the kind specially
fattened for the table, and which costs three or
four times the money. There is much sociability
among the English residents; and the cooler nature
of the climate enables them to have a greater
variety of al-fresco entertainments than is customary
in the tropical temperature of most parts of
India. Perhaps partly in consequence of this,
combined with its higher and more salubrious
situation, the district round Hyderabad is generally
very healthy; and people have lived there for
many years and enjoyed excellent health without
ever coming home at all. One well-known old
Scotch gentleman has resided chiefly there for fifty
years without ever returning to his native country;
and to judge from his active habits and hale
appearance, he will live there for many years to
come.</p>

<p>Among the native population, however, the
repulsive disease of leprosy is very prevalent; but
Europeans seldom or never suffer from it. This
dreadful malady is of two kinds: in one the type
is exceedingly malignant; the afflicted persons
are not permitted to go abroad, but are secluded
in buildings specially set aside for their reception,
and to all intents and purposes they are
dead to their fellow-men.</p>

<p>The supply of water in the locality is excellent,
mainly owing to the enormous reservoirs that have
been constructed in the vicinity of Hyderabad, used
principally for bathing both by the natives and by
Europeans. The largest of these is about twenty
miles round; and they are reached by numerous
flights of steps, which are generally thronged by
the natives at all hours of the day, for the double
purposes of ablution and washing their clothes.</p>

<p>Cotton is the staple production of the country;
but its other products and resources are being
rapidly developed by Sir Salar Jung, who has
organised large public works of various kinds, and
is opening new roads through the less frequented
portions of the Nizam's territory. If he could be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_520" id="Page_520">{520}</a></span>
induced to impose more taxes, a very great, and
also a justifiable increase of the revenue could be
easily effected; but to this measure he has an
invincible objection, alleging that it is a system to
which the subjects of the Nizam have been little
accustomed, and which would be unpalatable to all
classes alike. This may be true; but so enlightened
a ruler will probably ere long be brought to
acknowledge the necessity for a moderate adoption
of this system, both in the interests of his master
and in those of the real prosperity of the noble
dominions he has so long and so faithfully governed.</p>

<h2><a name="PRENTICE-LIFE_AT_SEA" id="PRENTICE-LIFE_AT_SEA">'PRENTICE-LIFE AT SEA.</a></h2>


<p><span class="smcap">The</span> sea is one of the most beautiful objects in
nature, whether we watch it breaking in playful
ripples on the pebbly beach, or shrink from it
aghast when it rushes along the shore in the full
thunder of its wrath, seething, tortured, convulsed,
struggling in the clutch of the storm-fiend. To
us in England who owe it so much, to us who have
for centuries reaped our harvests on its pathless
plains, and made of its trackless billows a highway
to fame and fortune, the sea has always
been an object of intense, almost passionate
interest. Hence there have never been wanting
among us volunteers for the wild sea-life of freedom
and adventure. The boy intended by fond
parents for quite a different fate, dreams of the
unknown sea as he creeps reluctant to and from
school, devouring it may be the while some well-thumbed
novel of Marryat's, instead of mastering
the intricacies of a Latin verb; until at last, the
passion growing with his growth, he leaves all else
behind him and finds his way to the shore, and
looks wonderingly at the great ships lying in the
harbour. Blissful Edens these, which have fought
many a battle with the mighty ocean, although
they are lying now so quietly in dock, with their
rigging stretching aloft like a network of twine,
and piles of cable lazily laid up on deck like so
many coiled snakes. Gradually he finds his way
on board, and then discovers that the rose has
thorns; that sea-life, in other words, is by no means
an Elysium.</p>

<p>Such a career is sketched for us in an amusing
book, <i>Two Years Abaft the Mast</i>, by F. W.
H. Symondson. The author was an apprentice
on board the <i>Sea Queen</i>, a sailing ship, bound for
Sydney with a general cargo. The ship was a good
one, registered A1 at Lloyd's, and carried a crew
of twelve able-bodied seamen, four ordinary seamen,
and three apprentices besides himself. There
were also three mates&mdash;the first, second, and third.</p>

<p>Naturally life at sea is made up very much of
routine, and the routine on board the <i>Sea Queen</i>
was after the following fashion. A sea-day commences
at mid-day, when we must suppose the
starboard watch, to which our apprentice belonged,
to be below. At twelve o'clock (eight bells) he
comes up along with his watch, to relieve the port
watch, who then have dinner. The second mate,
who has charge of the starboard watch, then sees
that every one goes to his proper work. He gives
an eye to the steering of the ship, and carefully
notes any shifting of the wind. A fresh helmsman
relieves the man at the wheel, and receives directions
as to steering from him; and our apprentice
being the youngest, looks after the time and strikes
the bells. At half-past twelve he strikers one bell,
at one o'clock two bells, and so on. At four o'clock,
eight bells are struck, and the port watch is called;
and as soon as the man at the wheel is relieved, the
starboard watch go below, and smoke or read or
spin yarns until tea-time, which is at five o'clock.
They then receive a pint of the pale inky coloured
nectar which does duty for tea on board ship, and
along with it salt pork or junk. This is cooked in
different ways; chopped up with biscuit, water, and
slush, by which is meant the grease from salt meat,
it forms a sea-delicacy called sconse. Another
<i>bonne bouche</i> is dandy-funk, which is compounded
of powdered biscuit, molasses, water, and slush;
while dogsbody, composed of pea-soup, powdered
biscuit, and slush, is also considered to form a
savoury and refreshing compound. At six o'clock
the other watch come below, and have their tea.
During the first dog-watch, from four to six, no
regular work is done, but no larking is allowed;
but the second watch, from six to eight, is given
up to fun and frolic of the maddest and merriest
description, such as chasing rats with belaying-pins,
or trying to turn the cook out of his galley,
while he defends himself with boiling water. At
eight o'clock the wild scrimmage ceases as if by
magic, the starboard watch turn into their berths,
and nothing is heard but the measured tread of the
look-out on the forecastle head, and the soft murmur
of the wind and sea, as the night-breeze fills the
sails, and the <i>Sea Queen</i> glides onward to her
destination through the rippling water.</p>

<p>At midnight the port watch is relieved, all hands
muster on deck, and the mate in charge sings out:
'Relieve the look-out! Relieve the man at the
wheel!' and then all is silent again until four o'clock,
when the starboard watch go below, and the port
watch come up.</p>

<p>The cook is called at four; and from half-past
five to six the men have their coffee, and then
comes the order: 'Brooms and buckets aft, to wash
the decks;' which shews that the work of the day
has begun. While the decks are being scrubbed, the
captain generally makes his appearance, and after
inspecting the compass and the sails, sits down in
his favourite arm-chair on the poop with a book.
On Saturday afternoons each watch are allowed an
hour to wash their clothes, and at half-past four or
five the stores for the week are served out: these
consist of articles such as sugar, vinegar, &amp;c.</p>

<p>In the little world of the ship, the captain is
an irresponsible autocrat; his word is law; to
refuse to obey him is mutiny. The sole command
of the navigation and working of the ship rests
with him, and the weather-side of the poop is his
private property when he chooses to come on
deck. In the ordinary daily work he seldom
interferes personally, but transmits all his orders
through the chief mate, who is a very important
officer, and who superintends everything. When the
cargo is stowed, he must give an acknowledgment
for it and for all goods in the hold, and must
make up any deficiencies. He must also keep
the log-book, which is a very important trust.
The officer of each watch marks upon the log-slate
the courses, the distance run, the winds, and any
subject of interest; and these at the end of every
twenty-four hours are copied into the official log-book
by the chief mate. The duties of the second<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_521" id="Page_521">{521}</a></span>
and third mate are less onerous; but they must
always be addressed by the prefix of 'Mr' and
answered with 'Sir.' The third mate has to dispense
the stores&mdash;a very unpopular office, and one which
does not fail to call down a shower of anything
but blessings upon his devoted head. A boatswain
is in general only carried by large ships, and his
sole duty is to look after the rigging and all that
concerns it. The carpenter is both an important
and independent personage on board ship; the
captain alone gives him his orders, and he has
nothing to do with any of the three mates; his
usual sobriquet is 'Chips.' The steward is in point
of fact the captain's servant, and although he is well
paid, he is generally looked down upon by the
crew, who call him 'Flunkey.'</p>

<p>Pursuing the narrative presented to us by the
<i>Sea Queen's</i> apprentice, we find that the cook,
if he is a good one, is a very important personage
on board ship; he answers generally to the
name of 'Slushy' or 'the Doctor,' and requires
to be, and indeed almost always is, an individual
of some resource, for he practises his calling amid
difficulties such as would utterly dismay a <i>chef de
cuisine</i> on land. His kitchen, to begin with, is
such a mite of a place that the wonder is that he
can fry, roast, or boil anything in it; then it is
provokingly subject to sudden inundations, partial
deluges which come tumbling in as if in sport,
playfully extinguishing his stove, and sending his
provisions, cooking utensils, and seasonings sliding
and spinning all around him; while if he is worth
his salt he will still, in spite of all these difficulties,
turn out such a meal for the cabin table
as Soyer under the circumstances need not have
blushed to own. As is befitting in the case of
such a superior being, he has certain social advantages;
he can smoke in his galley whenever he
chooses; and he slumbers peacefully all night in
the best bunk of the forecastle, blissfully unconscious
of the existence or claims of port or starboard
watches. The apprentices are not so well
off, although a premium of from thirty to sixty
guineas is sometimes paid for their term of four
years; the only advantage they have is living
apart from the crew. Their duties are the same
as those of a forecastle boy, and they share the
same food, which is sufficient in quantity, but
often very bad as to quality.</p>

<p>On the 9th March the first Australian sea-birds
were sighted; and on the morning of the 16th they
cast anchor in Sydney Harbour, which, with its
wooded hills sloping gently down to the sea, seemed
to our apprentice a perfect paradise of beauty. At
Sydney they remained a fortnight, enjoying the
luxury of very good and very cheap dinners, for
meat only cost from twopence to fourpence per
pound. After discharging their cargo, they sailed
to Newcastle, sixty miles distant, to take in a cargo
of coal, with which they sailed on the 23d April
for Hong-kong, where they arrived on the 15th of
June.</p>

<p>While at Hong-kong they had abundance of
buffalo-meat, eggs, fruit, and soft bread, and plenty
of hard work too, in washing out the hold of the
ship, which had been much begrimed by the coals,
to fit it for a cargo of tea. This the captain was
unable to obtain, and was in consequence obliged
to sail to Foo-chow, on the river Min, where, on
the 13th of July, they arrived at Pagoda anchorage,
so called from an old pagoda built on an
island in the river, which widens out here to the
dimensions of a small lake. Here also they waited
in vain for a freight of tea, and the captain at
last resolved to take a native cargo of poles to
Shanghae, and try for better luck there.</p>

<p>On the 14th September they entered the Yangtze-kiang,
where they found the scenery flat and
uninteresting, but yet home-like, for the river
reminded them of the Thames below London.</p>

<p>In the course of a week they unloaded their
timber, but still no freight of tea could be procured;
and the captain, after some delay, resolved
to return to Foo-chow, taking as ballast native
goods and medicines, two dozen sheep, and two
dozen passengers. On the voyage back to Foo-chow,
the cook having abandoned his post in
disgust at the sharpness of a new Chinese steward,
our apprentice was induced to volunteer his
services, and was formally installed in his new
office at four o'clock one fine morning. He began
his arduous task by trying to kindle a fire, which
for more than an hour obstinately resisted all his
efforts to make it burn. At last he succeeded in
evoking a tiny blaze, and thankful at heart even
for that small mercy, he placed upon his fire the
copper with water for the breakfast coffee, and
marched off elate to get the rations for the day.
It chanced to be a pork and pea-soup day; and
having got his supplies of pork and pease, he
returned to his galley, and was horror-struck to
find that the sea was washing into it every few
minutes, sometimes sportively rising almost as
high as the precious fire which had cost him so
much trouble. In his anxiety to preserve this
cherished flame, the little tub of pork, which he
had put out of his hands for a moment, capsized,
and its contents were washed swiftly round and
round the galley, to the surprise and disgust of the
unfortunate amateur. At last, giving chase, he
succeeded in capturing them with a considerable
admixture of cinders; and having placed the tub
and its heterogeneous contents out of harm's way,
he concentrated his energies upon the question of
the moment, which was coffee.</p>

<p>Tired of waiting for the water to boil, he
threw in the coffee, and then, to while away the
time, he began to pare some potatoes, which, by
some unaccountable fatality, as fast as they were
pared rolled out of the basin in which he placed
them, upon the floor. Whish! away went the
ship, lurching heavily, and away went the tub of
pork again; and pork, tub, and potatoes began
chasing each other round the galley in gallant style,
being kept in countenance by a couple of buckets,
which went frantically clanging and clanking
against each other and everything else that came
in their way. Despair shews itself in many ways:
at this crisis our apprentice laughed; and he was
still grinning over his own mishaps, when the
watch arrived, sharp set for their coffee.</p>

<p>They were by no means in a laughing humour
when they learned how the land lay, and neither
was he, for that matter, when they left him.
Convinced that at all risks he must make the water
boil, he frantically heaped upon the fire odd bits
of rope and canvas; but the water had a will of its
own, and boil it would not. Eight o'clock struck,
and again they came, each holding out an empty
hook-pot, which he filled with by no means the
best grace in the world, trying, as he ladled out
the vile mixture, to sink the coffee, which floated<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_522" id="Page_522">{522}</a></span>
like dust upon the surface. It would not do.
First one man came growling back, and then
another, and then the steward arrived to ask after
the captain's potatoes. The captain's potatoes! He
had forgotten all about them, and they had meanwhile
been having a rare lark of it on deck,
rattling first into one hole and then into another,
until at last the greater number of them had
scuttled overboard. What had he done? Had he
been guilty of mutiny, insubordination, or gross
carelessness as bad as either, on the high seas? In
his panic he stepped back into the galley, which,
for a wonder, happened to be free from water, and
a hot coal falling out of the stove, burned his foot;
and so ingloriously ended his career as cook.</p>

<p>At Pagoda Island the captain became seriously
ill; and notwithstanding the most careful nursing
on the part of his wife and our sailor apprentice,
he passed away without ever having recovered
consciousness, and was interred in the English
cemetery at Foo-chow.</p>

<p>On the 6th November, the <i>Sea Queen</i> having
loaded up, and being ready to start, a new captain
came on board, the crew standing by the break
of the forecastle and keenly eyeing him as he
stepped on deck. There was not much to look
at in him. He was a middle-sized man, with a
moustache and whiskers of a sandy red hue; and
that he did not despise his creature-comforts was
evident from the quantity of provisions that came
on board next day. He was, however, not illiberal
with his good things, but from time to time presented
the apprentices' mess with some little delicacies.
As for the question of questions always
asked by a crew with regard to a new captain:
'Does he carry on?' that is, does he risk a large
press of sail in a stiff wind, it had to be
answered in the negative. He was, in fact, as
timid as his predecessor had been, but from
a different cause&mdash;he had always formerly commanded
a steamer, and his new duties were strange
to him.</p>

<p>They had now been at sea for several weeks,
when one lovely evening our apprentice was with
his watch on deck, and had just lain down for an
hour's nap, when the after-bell was struck hurriedly
three times. As it was his duty to keep the time,
and as the three strokes had, moreover, nothing to
do with the proper hour, he suspected that something
was wrong with the helmsman, a Swede,
Edghren Andrews, and was just about to verify
his suspicion, when the man rushed up to him and
said: 'Will you take the wheel for a minute? I
feel very sick; perhaps a swig of cold tea will set
me up.' He went to get it; and in a few minutes
returned to his post, where he had scarcely been
a quarter of an hour, when the bell was again
struck twice. A second time he went to the helmsman's
assistance, and on the poop met Andrews,
who said he was worse than ever; whereupon
our apprentice offered to finish up his time for
him.</p>

<p>Next morning the Swede took him into the forecastle
and related the following curious story. The
evening before, while at the wheel, he had suddenly
seen the late captain on the weather-side
of the poop, anxiously looking up at the sails
and sky; and while he stared at him in mute
surprise, he turned round angrily, and looked at
him with such a horrible expression of face, that
he dropped the wheel in a panic and rang the bell.
In Sweden, he said, ghosts were supposed to have
a special dislike to a knife and to the Bible; so he
rushed below to procure them, by way of charm;
but although he could have got a whole bucketful
of knives, he could not lay his hands upon a
single Bible; and so he took instead a Swedish
novel, thinking that as the late captain had not
understood Swedish, it could not make much
difference. He soon found, however, that he had
reckoned without his host. He was no sooner set
down to the wheel than the ghost reappeared, and
approaching the binnacle, looked at the compass,
and made angry signs to him to alter the vessel's
course. So much for sea superstitions.</p>

<p>On boxing-day the ordinary routine of ship-life
was broken by a terrible accident. The port watch
had just finished tea, and had turned into their
bunks for a smoke and a read, when a frightful
clamour and trampling of feet got up overhead.
In a moment every one was on deck, where all
was in the wildest hurry and confusion. 'A man
overboard!' was the cry. 'Who is it? Who is gone?'
asked half-a-dozen voices. 'Johnson!' answered
the second mate, excitedly hauling at a rope.
'Haul up the mainsail!' shouted the mate, in tones
that rung clear and high above the uproar. 'Slack
away the sheet, lads! Bear down on the clew
garnets.' All was in vain: the sea was so high
that the ship could not be brought round to the
wind, and the captain would not hear of a boat
being launched. 'It would only,' he very justly
said, 'put more lives in jeopardy.' With breathless
excitement the look-outs at each mast-head
strained their eyes into the darkness of the wild
night. The black waves were tumbling mountain
high, and there, like a cork upon the billows, was
their drowning messmate, slowly drifting astern
to his doom. A cold shudder ran through the
veins of the breathless watchers. Could nothing
be done to help him? Nothing! The helmsman
threw him a life-buoy as he passed; perhaps he
seized it, perhaps he did not: he was never seen
again.</p>

<p>On the 26th February they reached New York;
and after unloading their tea, took in a cargo
of grain and resin, and sailed for London on the
15th of March. It was a bad season of the year,
and the ship was overladen with grain, which
makes a peculiarly heavy and unelastic cargo.
The weather, stormy from the first, grew gradually
worse until the 23d of March, when the gale
freshened into a tempest, and that again into the
wildest conceivable hurricane. Some frightful
hours followed; the waves rolled along the bulwarks
like mountains of blackish green water; the roar of
wind and sea was inconceivably fearful, and suggested
to the shivering crew the idea of something
demoniac. At last it became evident to all, that
unless the sails could be got rid of, the ship would
founder. Who was to risk his life in the attempt?
What hero would be found to do this deed of
courage? As usual the hour brought the man in
the person of Jack Andersen, a Swedish sailor.
With his open knife between his teeth, this brave
fellow sprang along the encumbered deck undaunted
by a heavy sea which broke over him;
and soon a loud explosion told of his success; the
last sail was gone, and the <i>Sea Queen</i> lay like a
helpless log upon the waters. At three in the
morning a lull occurred, and the wind and sea
gradually went down; but the vessel continuing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_523" id="Page_523">{523}</a></span>
to sink deeper in the water, it was necessary to
lighten her, and fifty tons of cargo were thrown
overboard. The sacrifice saved her; and on the
1st of April they sighted the welcome Lizard light.
As for the suffering and discomfort on board subsequent
to the storm, it was simply inconceivable.
Our apprentice's chest floated bottom up for days;
and his log-book, which was locked up in it, got
a thorough soaking, which fortunately did not
render it illegible, else we should have missed a
very graphic and interesting narrative of life at
sea.</p>

<h2><a name="ONLY_TRIFLES" id="ONLY_TRIFLES">'ONLY TRIFLES.'</a></h2>


<p><span class="smcap">When</span> tempted to scorn the little duties of our
calling, let us think of such sayings as the following.
One day a visitor at Michael Angelo's studio
remarked to that great artist, who had been describing
certain little finishing 'touches' lately given to
a statue&mdash;'But these are only trifles.' 'It may
be so,' replied the sculptor; 'but recollect that
trifles make perfection, and perfection is no trifle.'
In the same spirit the great painter Poussin
accounted for his reputation in these words&mdash;'Because
I have neglected nothing.' It is related
of a Manchester manufacturer, that, on retiring
from business, he purchased an estate from a
certain nobleman. The arrangement was that he
should have the house with all its furniture just
as it stood. On taking possession, however, he
found that a cabinet which was in the inventory
had been removed; and on applying to the former
owner about it, the latter said: 'Well, I certainly
did order it to be removed; but I hardly thought
you would have cared for so trifling a matter in so
large a purchase.' 'My lord,' was the reply, 'if I
had not all my life attended to trifles, I should not
have been able to purchase this estate; and excuse
me for saying so, perhaps if your lordship had
cared more about trifles, you might not have had
occasion to sell it.' 'Oh, what's the good of doing
this and that?' we say in reference to departments
of our business where quick returns are not forthcoming,
or where success does not at once stare us
in the face. When Franklin made his discovery
of the identity of lightning and electricity, people
of this baser sort asked with a sneer 'Of what use
is it?' The philosopher's retort was: 'What is
the use of a child? It may become a man!'
Apropos of this remark, grown-up people should
remember while doing improper things in the
presence of him who is 'only a child,' that he will
one day become a man just like themselves.</p>

<p>Mr Careless Nevermind and Miss Notparticular
think that great men only deal with great things.
The most brilliant discoverers were of a different
opinion. They made their discoveries by observing
and interpreting simple facts. When fools were
walking in darkness, the eyes of these wise men
were in their heads. Galileo's discovery of the
pendulum was suggested to his observant eye by a
lamp swinging from the ceiling of Pisa Cathedral.
A spider's net suspended across the path of Sir
Samuel Brown, as he walked one dewy morning in
his garden, was the prompter that gave to him the
idea of his suspension bridge across the Tweed.
So trifling a matter as the sight of seaweed floating
past his ship, enabled Columbus to quell the
mutiny which arose amongst his sailors at not
discovering land, and to assure them that the
eagerly sought New World was not far off. Galvani
observed that a frog's leg twitched when
placed in contact with different metals, and it was
this apparently insignificant fact that led to the
invention of the electric telegraph. While a bad
observer may 'go through a forest and see no firewood,'
a true <i>seer</i> learns from the smallest things
and apparently the most insignificant people.
'Sir,' said Dr Johnson to a fine gentleman just
returned from Italy, 'some men will learn more in
the Hampstead stage than others in the tour of
Europe.' Certainly the power of little things can
never be denied by Englishmen who reflect that
the chalk cliffs of their island have been built up
by little animals&mdash;detected only by the help of
the microscope&mdash;of the same order of creatures
that have formed the coral reefs.</p>

<p>Perhaps it is not too much to say that England
owes her reputation of being the best workshop in
Europe not so much to the fact that she is rich in
coal and iron, as because her workmen put or used
to put a good finish on their work. A country
must become and continue great when its labourers
work honestly, paying attention to detail, putting
<i>conscience</i> into every stone they place and into
every nail they drive. There is no fear of England
declining so long as it can be said of her workers
what was said of the Old Masters in statuary,
painting, and cathedral-building:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">In the elder days of art,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Builders wrought with greatest care<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Each minute and unseen part,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">For the gods are everywhere.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>How much of this honest workmanship, that careth
for little things and not merely for the large and
showy, is to be seen on the roof of Milan Cathedral!
Here the smallest and least visible statue of the
statue forest that tops the building, is carved with
quite as great care as the largest and most conspicuous.</p>

<p>It has been remarked that we cannot change
even a particle of sand on the sea-shore to a different
place without changing at the same time the
balance of the globe. The earth's centre of gravity
will be altered by the action, in an infinitely
small degree no doubt, but still altered; and upon
this will ensue climatic change which may influence
people's temperaments and actions. Of course
this is an absurd refinement; but it illustrates the
undoubted fact that the most trivial thought and
act in our lives carries with it a train of consequences,
the end of which we may never guess.
The veriest trifles become of importance in influencing
our own or other people's lives and characters.
One look may marry us. Our profession
may be settled for us by the most trivial circumstance.
'A kiss from my mother,' said West,
'made me a painter.' Going into an inn for
refreshment, Dr Guthrie saw a picture of John
Pounds the cobbler of Portsmouth teaching poor
ragged children that had been left by ministers,
ladies, and gentlemen to go to ruin on the streets.
The sight of this picture hanging over the chimney-piece
on that day, made Dr Guthrie the founder
of ragged schools.</p>

<p>On a clock in one of the Oxford colleges is
inscribed this solemn warning to those who fancy
that killing time is not murder: <i>Periunt et imputantur</i>
(the hours perish and are laid to our charge).
But is not this equally true of those 'odd moments'<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_524" id="Page_524">{524}</a></span>
during which we say it is not worth while commencing
or finishing anything? Mr Smiles tells
us that Dr Mason Good translated Lucretius while
driving from patient's house to patient's house;
that Dr Darwin composed nearly all his works in
the same way; that Hale wrote his <i>Contemplations</i>
while travelling on circuit; that Elihu Burritt
while earning his living as a blacksmith mastered
eighteen ancient languages and twenty-two European
dialects in 'odd moments;' that Madame de
Genlis composed several of her volumes while
waiting for the princess to whom she gave daily
lessons. Kirke White learned Greek and J. S.
Mill composed <i>Logic</i> as they walked to their
offices. Many of us get into a fuss if the dinner
be not to the moment. Not so did D'Aguesseau,
one of the greatest Chancellors of France, act. He
<i>used</i> this <i>mauvais quart d'heure</i>, for he is said to
have written a large and able volume in the
intervals of waiting for dinner. Wellington's
achievements were mainly owing to the fact that
he personally attended to such minutiÃ¦ as soldiers'
shoes, camp-kettles, biscuits, horse-fodder; and it
was because Nelson attended to detail in respect
of time that he was so victorious. 'I owe,' he said,
'all my success in life to having been always a
quarter of an hour before my time.' 'Every
moment lost,' said Napoleon, 'gives an opportunity
for misfortune.' Well would it have been for
himself&mdash;as his bitter end proved&mdash;had this
European bully known another fact&mdash;that every
moment selfishly employed is worse than lost, and
'gives an opportunity for misfortune!' However,
he attributed the defeat of the Austrians to his
own greater appreciation of the value of time.
While they dawdled he overthrew them.</p>

<p>It may be said that 'it is the pace that
kills&mdash;that people nowadays are more prone to
wear themselves out by overworking than to rust
unused.' But is it not over-anxiety and want of
method, rather than overwork, that kills us?
Methodical arrangement of time is like packing
things in a box; a good packer will get in half as
much again as a bad one.</p>

<p>Little words and acts far more than great ones
reveal the manner of a man. No one&mdash;in Great
Britain at least&mdash;could be such a Goth as to rest
his heels on the mantel-piece or to spit when
sitting in the company of ladies round a fire. It
is not, however, given to all to continue sinless as
regards those many little things that mark the
naturally refined man. Women are said to be better
readers of character than men, and perhaps the
reason is this: character is shewn by minutiÃ¦,
and the fine intuition or mental sharp-sightedness
by which these are discerned, belongs to women in
a greater degree than to men.</p>

<p>Without caring in the smallest degree for goodness,
we may avoid crime and gross sin because
of the police, or because we desire to get on in the
world, or because we are afraid of ridicule. The
test, therefore, of a fine character is attention to the
minutiÃ¦ of conduct. Nor does the performance of
those large duties which are almost forced upon us
prove our love to God or to man nearly so convincingly
as do the little commonplace services of
love&mdash;the cheerful word, the cup of cold water&mdash;when
rendered not grudgingly or of necessity. By
little foxes tender grapes are destroyed, according
to Solomon. Little foxes are very cunning and
most difficult to catch; and so are those little
temptations by which our moral natures are gradually
eaten away. The tender grapes of many
a Christian branch are destroyed by such little
foxes as temper, discontent, avarice, vanity. Many
who could resist much greater sins yield to these.
There is an excitement in the very greatness of a
trial or temptation which enables us to resist it;
while the chase after little foxes is dull and uninteresting.
No wonder that when we analyse the
lives of those who have ruined themselves morally,
we generally discover that</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">It was the little rift within the lute<br /></span>
<span class="i2">That, ever widening, slowly silenced all;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or little pitted speck in garnered fruit,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">That, rotting inward, slowly mouldered all.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>How many people are <i>almost</i> successful, missing
their aim by 'Oh, such a little!' MinutiÃ¦ in
these cases make or mar us. 'If I am building
a mountain,' said Confucius, 'and stop before the
last basketful of earth is placed on the summit, I
have failed.' The examination is lost by half a
mark. One neck nearer and the race would have
been won. The slightest additional effort would
have turned the tide of war. 'Thou art not far
from the kingdom of God,' were solemn words,
marking the terrible difference between almost and
altogether.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">When</span> the Territory of Kansas applied to the
government at Washington for the privilege of
adding another star to the national flag&mdash;now
nearly twenty-five years ago&mdash;conflicting interests
were involved in the very important question as to
whether she should enter the Union as a free or a
slave state. Some of the foremost abolitionists of
the North were determined that no territory should
be added to the Union as a slave state; Southerners
were equally resolute that the limits of slavery
should no longer be circumscribed; while others,
affecting a more moderate temper, offered to leave
the settlement of the matter to the people themselves
who sought the more extended national
relationship. At this time the public mind was
in a highly excited condition. The effect of the
iniquitous 'Fugitive Slave Law'&mdash;passed in a
spirit of conciliation towards the South, and for
assisting which, by his vote, the illustrious Daniel
Webster sacrificed much of his well-earned reputation&mdash;had
not died away when, in 1852, the statute
was suddenly put into practical operation in the
city of Boston, and a scene was there enacted which
is without a parallel in American history. A negro
named Burns having escaped from bondage, settled
in Boston, and for some years had earned an honest
living as a waiter at hotels and in sundry other
occupations in which men of his race were accustomed
to be engaged. The Fugitive Slave Law
empowered slaveholders to follow runaways into
free states and remove them therefrom; and Burns'
owner having discovered the fugitive's whereabouts,
resolved on the exercise of his newly-acquired
rights. Burns was arrested and lodged in jail.
The news spread with the speed and effect of an
electric shock. The whole city was moved. With<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_525" id="Page_525">{525}</a></span>
youthful ardour many of the students of Harvard
College (located at the neighbouring suburb of
Cambridge) assailed the prison, with a view to the
forcible liberation of the captive. So quickly had
the riot assumed a portentous aspect, that a large
force of police and soldiery was called into requisition
to quell the disturbance. The representatives
of the law succeeded in at once restoring peace
and in placing in custody many of the students and
other citizens who had attempted, though in vain,
to render a humane service to an oppressed fellow-creature.</p>

<p>The quiet of the following day&mdash;Sunday&mdash;failed
to allay the excitement which had seized the public
mind. As the people issued from the various
places of worship the proceedings of the previous
day formed the general theme of conversation;
groups of eager citizens were to be seen here and
there discussing the outrage which had been perpetrated
in the very 'cradle of liberty' itself.</p>

<p>Those who had been placed under arrest were,
however, liberated shortly afterwards; and so soon
as the necessary legal preliminaries were settled,
arrangements were made for the transfer of the
negro to his owner. Early on the morning of his
removal, the streets in the neighbourhood of the
jail were strictly closed against all traffic, by ropes,
guarded by police, traversing their approaches. A
cannon was placed in position on the court-house
steps; and, still further to secure the captive
against any probable attempt at rescue on the part
of the populace, the police, supported by cavalry
in the rear with drawn sabres, lined the thoroughfares
through which he had to walk to the harbour,
where a vessel was in readiness to convey him
southwards. To add significance to this extraordinary
scene, a coffin was suspended in mid-air on
ropes running diagonally from the upper windows
of the four corners of Washington Street, where it
is intersected by School Street on the west and
State Street on the east&mdash;the avenues through
which Burns would pass&mdash;and most of the buildings
in this locality were draped in mourning.
Such space as was available for spectators was
filled to overflowing with expectant citizens. The
surging masses swayed to and fro with excitement;
and when the slave appeared in charge of the
officials, the murmured execrations of an indignant
but law-observing multitude arose as incense. The
ship lying in the harbour received him on board,
and a fair wind soon wafted him beyond the reach
of any manifestation of Northern sympathy.</p>

<p>Such, then, was the state of public or, rather,
Northern feeling when Kansas, as already stated,
applied for admission into the Union. The slaveholders
of the South, and all in sympathy with
them, adopted measures for influencing and,
indeed, of controlling public opinion in Kansas
on this great question; and to achieve this end,
mercenary agents were employed to foster such
'slave' proclivities as might be apparent, and to
instil them into the minds of the people, if their
political sentiments were found to be tinged with
'free' tendencies. Not only was this virtually
acknowledged, but it was discovered that preparations
had been made for the exercise of physical
force if need be. The Northerners, and more
especially the abolitionists of the New England
States, impelled by a righteous impulse to neutralise,
as far as lay in their power, every unscrupulous
endeavour to extend slave territory, sent
arms to the inhabitants, to enable them to meet
force with force. Jealousy of political ascendency
culminated in aggressive measures being adopted
by the pro-slavery party. Espionage, with its
attendant evils, was organised: men were tarred
and feathered, and ridden on a rail or lynched,
until the 'border warfare' was an acknowledged
fact.</p>

<p>At this juncture, a literary gentleman named
S&mdash;&mdash;, strongly imbued with Northern zeal, but
lacking the discretion which should accompany
every important and worthy undertaking, decided
on venturing into the midst of the disturbance, for
the purpose of advocating anti-slavery principles
by establishing an 'abolition' newspaper. He
took a printing-press, type, paper, and such appliances
as were required. His wife, not deterred by
the length of the journey or the dangers which
attended it, insisted on accompanying him on his
perilous enterprise. After a journey of about one
thousand five hundred miles, he settled near Fort
Leavenworth, not far from the Missouri river, and
soon completed his arrangements for starting his
paper. Considering his surroundings, it was not
likely that any great length of time would elapse
before he acquired a reputation as a dangerous
political intruder. His first issue startled the
people immensely; but whether his anti-slavery
vagaries, as they were considered, should be resented,
or laughed at as an evidence of playful
temerity, was for the moment a moot-point. The
times, however, were not laughing times, and he
was speedily a marked man. Intimations were
conveyed to him by the process known as 'underground'
that he had better relinquish his undertaking
and hurry home to the east; and that in
the event of his non-compliance with these hints,
he would be waited upon by certain parties who
made such matters their special vocation. In
spite of these warnings, he continued to publish
his unsavoury journal.</p>

<p>Amongst those who assumed the surveillance
and guardianship of the public weal, political <i>and
moral</i>, was one Dick M&mdash;&mdash;. Dick was reputed to
have been of respectable parentage, and to have
spent his early days in peaceful circles; but the
allurements of a desperado's life charmed him
away to the sphere of action in which he was now
engaged. His belt was amply supplied with the
means of offence or defence, just as his 'appurtenances'
might be required; and whether accompanied
in his inquisitorial migrations by his
followers or not, never failed to make his presence
felt. In short, Dick was one of the most daring
and blood-thirsty ruffians that could be encountered,
and wherever he presented himself, dismay
was widespread.</p>

<p>Very early one morning, as S&mdash;&mdash; was printing
his paper preparatory to its distribution, his office
door was opened and several men entered. The
ceremony of a formal introduction was dispensed
with; his printing-press was smashed, his property
destroyed, and the office itself quickly demolished.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_526" id="Page_526">{526}</a></span>
Dick&mdash;for it was he&mdash;and his comrades arrested
S&mdash;&mdash;; but his wife was permitted to take leave
of her husband on promising to return eastward
without delay. The parting, under such circumstances,
may readily be imagined; but in the
absence of efficient protection to life and property,
no reasonable alternative was left; the separation
must be.</p>

<p>S&mdash;&mdash; was speedily marched by his ignominious
escort towards the Missouri. It was usual in
such cases to 'string up' the delinquent to the first
tree the parties met with; but on this occasion
it was intended to convey the prisoner to such a
place as might enable them to invest their proceedings
with more than the customary spectacular
effect. Such desperadoes considered it beneath
their manly dignity to travel far without refreshment;
they therefore soon stopped at a tavern to
satisfy their conventional thirst. S&mdash;&mdash; was placed
in an arm-chair at the end of the saloon, while the
masters of the situation lounged around the bar.
Presently, Dick sauntered up to his captive and
entered into conversation with him.</p>

<p>'Wal, stranger,' said Dick, 'I reckon you had
better ha' stayed at New York, instead of coming
to Kansas with them abolition notions o' yourn;
we don't want no abolition out at Kansas.'</p>

<p>'I did not come out here,' S&mdash;&mdash; mildly
answered, 'for the purpose of creating discord,
for it already existed; but simply and honestly
to promulgate views which, in my conscience, I
believe to be right; and I did it <i>because it is right</i>.'</p>

<p>'Wal,' blustered Dick, 'that kind of talk may
do away at New York, but I cal'late it won't
amount to nothin' out here. I can't believe any
man would be sech a fool as to do sech a thing
'cause he believes it right. I don't believe you,
nohow.'</p>

<p>'Well,' replied S&mdash;&mdash;, 'if you were a member of
a society I belong to, you would believe me.'</p>

<p>'What do you mean, stranger?' asked Dick with
an air of wonderment.</p>

<p>S&mdash;&mdash;, conscious of the hopelessness of his
position, and fearing almost momentarily to be
put to death, ventured: 'If you were a mason'&mdash;accompanying
the remark with a certain sign usual
in such emergencies&mdash;' you would believe me.'</p>

<p>To his utter amazement and infinite satisfaction,
this chief of villains proved to be a freemason,
having joined the fraternity in his reputable days,
and fortunately for S&mdash;&mdash;, still respected his obligations.</p>

<p>'Wal, brother, this is a kind o' awkward,' said
Dick, in an altered and friendly tone; 'but I
reckon I must save you. The boys will be mighty
ugly though, when they see how things is. Now,
when you hear the steamer whistle as she comes
down the river, keep close to me, and follow me
on board. I'll lock you in a cabin on deck, and as
I know the cap'n, I'll make it all right. But
look alive when she comes.'</p>

<p>They had not to wait many minutes before a
shrill whistle announced the steamer's arrival.
All left the tavern together, Dick marching ahead,
and holding S&mdash;&mdash; by the arm, as if leading an
unwilling captive. As these two stepped on the
plank thrown out for passengers to walk on from
bank to deck, the 'boys' intuitively perceived the
state of things, and made a rush towards the plank.
Dick was equal to the occasion.</p>

<p>'Now, boys, make tracks!' said he in a tone
and manner that made obedience other than impossible.
They accordingly withdrew, muttering
threats of vengeance at the loss of their prey.</p>

<p>Dick hurried S&mdash;&mdash; into a deck cabin, and
without waiting for any expression of thanks for
the service he had rendered, locked the door, and
hastened to make all right with the 'cap'n,' according
to promise. In a few moments the engines
moved, the paddles revolved, and the steamer was
under weigh for St Louis. Here S&mdash;&mdash; disembarked;
and again taking steamer for Alton, and
thence cars to Cincinnati, was not long in meeting
his wife in New York.</p>

<p>S&mdash;&mdash;'s anti-slavery sentiments continued to the
last as strong as in his early days, though, having
an ever vivid recollection of his visit to the south-west,
his utterance on this particular theme grew
somewhat feeble. There was one topic, however,
on which he waxed eloquent, and that was his
gratitude to freemasonry for having, under Providence,
preserved him from certain death.</p>

<h2><a name="FIGHTING_FOR_LIFE" id="FIGHTING_FOR_LIFE">FIGHTING FOR LIFE.</a></h2>

<p class='ph3'>A STORY OF A WELSH COAL-MINE.</p>


<p><span class="smcap">In</span> all parts of the habitable globe wherever the
English language is spoken, a thrill of admiration
must have passed through every English heart at
the brave deed which was, in the earlier part of
this year, accomplished in the Welsh coal-pit at
Troedyrhiw.</p>

<p>There are times when a display of national
pride is not only justifiable but necessary; and it
is a splendid victory gained for humanity when
we see a whole nation, heedless of every other
event which is taking place around her, hanging
breathlessly and with anxious face over the mouth
of a pit in which a few poor miners are engaged
in a hand-to-hand struggle with Death; tortured
with doubts as to whether the imprisoned miners
in the Troedyrhiw Colliery would endure their
fearful hardships long enough to enable themselves
to be snatched from a living grave. Happily,
they did so, and <i>were</i> saved by the indomitable
bravery of their fellow-miners. The whole
story is one more splendid instance of the
noble qualities which are innate in the breasts of
those who form the sinew and the backbone of
Britain; qualities that have won for her undying
glory in war or peace, and by flood and field.
How bravely death can be faced, and how bravely
fought even in moments of doubt and despair,
and at the risk of terrible perils deliberately
encountered, is shewn by this story.</p>

<p>A miner's life is at all times a subject for grave
study, for he must by mere necessity be a brave
man, knowing as he does that every time he
descends the shaft he literally carries his life with
him in his hands. Indeed this thought must
cross the mind of the most hardened man; and
when he reaches the pit, the feeling must be intensified,
for here his responsibility increases with
every step he takes along the glistening black
galleries of the mine. Not only has he his own
life, but also the lives of others, now in his hands;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_527" id="Page_527">{527}</a></span>
and the striking of a match may in an instant
consign hundreds of his fellow-creatures to a fearful
death in the bowels of the earth.</p>

<p>It was the writer's privilege, some few years
since, to pay a visit to one of the largest and finest
coal-pits in England&mdash;the Sheepbridge Colliery,
near Chesterfield; the galleries of which extend in
several directions for a long distance, covering
altogether about three miles of ground, and passing
in one place beneath a small lake. The sensation
one experiences on descending the shaft, and seeing
the light of day fading rapidly from view, is
almost indescribable; and is only equalled by the
exquisite feeling of relief which pervades the mind
on once again returning to the surface.</p>

<p>An amusing incident occurred during our visit,
which, though it was the cause of much hilarity
at the moment, would seem on reflection to be,
perchance, the innocent cause of many great
disasters in coal-mines. As is probably well known,
the miners in many pits, especially in those which
are considered free from fire-damp or gas, work
by the light of candles, which are stuck here and
there against the walls of coal, a reserve of candles
lying near at hand. These candles, the rats&mdash;the
only living companions of the miners&mdash;make free
use of when they can get a chance; and while we
were watching the digging of some coal, one of
these creatures came stealthily up to the spot and
ran off with the lighted candle in its mouth. A
volley of coal and curses flew after the robber;
but it kept on its course until both rat and candle
disappeared from view. But to our story.</p>

<p>It was on the evening of the 11th April, when
the miners in the Troedyrhiw Colliery were leaving
their work, that a roar of rushing waters was
heard. The sound is one that is too well known
to the ears of experienced pitmen, and the men
at once fled to the shaft and were raised to the
surface; but on arrival at the pit's mouth, fourteen
of their number&mdash;men and boys&mdash;were seen to be
missing. In an instant and without the slightest
hesitation, volunteers nobly stood forward to
undertake the task of rescue, and immediately
descended the pit again, for the purpose, if possible,
of bringing their fellow-miners to the 'bank' in
safety. It was found that the water had broken
into the mine through some old abandoned workings,
and was flowing into all the stalls, headings,
and galleries into which the mine was divided.
The volunteers found also that all the workings
within a few hundred yards of the bottom of the
shaft were filled with water up to the roof, and
it was at first concluded that all the fourteen
missing ones were drowned. A knocking was,
however, heard, as if some of the men were confined
behind a wall of coal accessible from the
outside; and the volunteers at once determined to
cut through this wall, which they believed to be
about twelve yards thick. The imprisoned men
worked from their side too; and in a few hours
the obstruction was so far removed as to enable
the two parties to speak to each other. The tale
of the imprisoned men was, that the water was
rapidly gaining on them, and one of them struck
through the coal to escape from the rising water.
But from one peril they immediately passed to
another, for a violent explosion followed, and one
poor fellow, Thomas Morgan, was found jammed
to death in the hole which had been cut. This
sad accident was caused by the sudden escape of
air which was pent up in the 'stall' in which
they had stood out of the way of the water, and
the act of making the hole through the coal in so
sudden a manner was equivalent to applying a
match to a heap of powder or pulling the trigger
of a gun. It was fortunate they were not all
killed by the explosion.</p>

<p>After this, knockings were heard farther on in
the mine; and it was soon made evident that the
position of the other nine men was worse than
that of the miners just reached. The wall behind
which they were imprisoned was in a heading that
was entirely flooded, and they could only be
reached after part of the water had been pumped
out. Divers were here employed, who went boldly
into the flood, and gallantly endeavoured to proceed
through the half mile of water which lay
between the shaft and the imprisoned miners; but
these were unwillingly compelled to relinquish the
attempt. On Monday, however, four days after
the flooding of the mine, the water was so far
reduced as to allow the work of cutting through
the coal to be commenced. And here we must
pause to mention that this was done with a powerful
pumping apparatus, which, with all its appliances,
had to be properly and cautiously fitted
up before it could be put into successful operation.
The poor fellows below had been without food for
some five days now, and it thus became a question
of patient endurance on the one hand and of
unceasing labour and noble efforts on the other.
And never did men work more nobly than did
those who were thus doing all that lay in the
power of man to save the lives of their devoted
comrades.</p>

<p>In spite of their indefatigable efforts, however,
day after day passed by without any apparent
result, for they had to cut through <i>forty yards of
solid coal</i>, and the difficulty increased as the intervening
wall became thinner. The anxiety of all
concerned may be imagined when we remind our
readers that this immense block of coal could only
be penetrated at the rate of a yard per hour. But
relays of men worked night and day with unremitting
zeal until at length their efforts were
rewarded with success. The imprisoned men were
heard, and were able not only to speak to their
deliverers, but also to give directions as to the
course of the cuttings. 'Make haste! make haste!'
was the plaintive cry which now nerved the hands
and arms of the heroic workers, for it was like a
voice from the grave which thus reached their
ears.</p>

<p>Questioned as to their mode of existence in the
mine, the prisoners said they had eaten absolutely
nothing, that they were all very weak, and two
of their number were completely prostrated.
There were only four men and a boy there, the
other four having been cut off from their fellows,
and had, as since ascertained, perished. The
little boy piteously implored the workers to make
a hole for him to creep through to his mother.
But in spite of their willing hearts, the brave<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_528" id="Page_528">{528}</a></span>
toilers were compelled to proceed more slowly and
cautiously than before, in order to prevent the
recurrence of a second disaster, by the too sudden
escape of the pent-up air. And in addition to this,
there was great danger of themselves being engulfed
in the waters or killed by the gas, which
soon began to make its unwelcome presence felt.
Food was passed along a tube to the imprisoned
men; but the tube did not work well, and it was
eventually found that they had not received the
much-desired refreshment. At the last moment,
when the hole had been made and the compressed
air was let out, a rush of gas took place which put
out all the lamps and compelled the workers to
return to the 'bank.' What must have been the
horror of that moment to those poor fellows within
the mine when they heard the retreating footsteps
of their anxiously awaited deliverers!</p>

<p>Gloomy indeed was the prospect at this critical
moment, for it had now become a question of life
and death to either party; but were the men who
had been rescued thus far to be left after all to the
death which seemed to hunger for them? Perish
the thought! and perish rather every Englishman
who stood at the pit's mouth than that no attempt
should be made to complete and crown the splendid
story of those past <i>eight</i> days. The danger of
carrying lights in the gas-charged mine being too
great to be ignored, brave men came forward and
volunteered to go down <i>without lamps</i> to the rescue
of the five miners whom it was now known were
the only ones who had survived that fearful time.
Down they went into the black pit, carrying food
with them, and on making another hole a gallant
collier went into the mine and fed the poor fellows.
All honour to him! It was a greater deed than
the capture of an enemy's colours on the battlefield.</p>

<p>The rescued men and the boy were then brought
to the surface, and placed under the care of experienced
doctors, who pronounced favourably on their
condition. For <i>ten</i> long weary days they had languished
in the darkness of what seemed to them a
living tomb, yet they murmured not, but lifted up
their united voices in prayer to the great Creator
of all.</p>

<p>The entombment of nine men, five of whom
were known to be in a certain place, and could be
saved by cutting through some forty yards of coal,
made the question one of time and dogged perseverance
on one side, and of hunger and patient
endurance on the other. It is just on such occasions
as these that the really splendid qualities
of the collier shew themselves in bold relief, and
turn a pitman into a hero.</p>

<p>Such a deed as this was certain to attract the
sympathy of the gracious Lady who has ever the
welfare of her people at heart; and the Queen
hastened at once to give expression to the national
feeling of admiration for these brave men, by
extending the institution of the Albert Medal for
saving life at sea to similar acts performed on land,
and giving directions that these humble Welsh
miners should be the first recipients of the honour.</p>

<p>A national subscription was also opened by the
Lord Mayor, and a large sum collected for the
rescued and their rescuers, sufficient to place them
beyond the reach of poverty, and shew the world
that England will not willingly let die the remembrance
of as noble and heroic a deed as ever graced
the annals of a Christian people.</p>

<h2><a name="QUACK_MEDICINE" id="QUACK_MEDICINE">QUACK MEDICINE.</a></h2>


<p><span class="smcap">Our</span> ably conducted contemporary, <i>The Queen</i>, has
the following useful remarks on the use of Quack
Medicine:</p>

<p>'The belief in quack medicine is one which exists
in strength proportioned to the ignorance of the
persons who take it. There are certain charms, to
some minds, in being able to "doctor" themselves,
and to do without the properly authorised medical
practitioner. There seems to be with these persons
a sense that, in not having paid a fee for advice,
they have in a manner gained something. There
appears to be also a love of experiment, with a
sense behind it that, if their own experiment fails,
they can at worst fall back on the skilled physician
to amend their mistakes, and to set them up again
according to the known and acknowledged rules
and practices of medical science. Moreover there
is a kind of belief in empirical treatment, which is
probably a "survival" from the ancient belief in
charms and witchcraft; else how can people possibly
put trust in medicines which are advertised
as being adapted to cure all manner of diseases of
thoroughly differing characters?</p>

<p>'But even among quack medicines there are
degrees. There are some of which ordinary medical
men readily avail themselves, and which under
proper direction may be found really useful. The
danger with regard to them is that persons finding
such to be useful in the doses prescribed by their
medical advisers, take doses on their own responsibility,
which prove hurtful, sometimes even fatal
in their effects. On the other hand there are a
few&mdash;though we must confess very few&mdash;whose
virtues chiefly arise from the faith with which
they are taken; and these are as innocuous to the
patient as they are profitable only to the vendor.
But a very large class&mdash;in fact by far the largest&mdash;are
really positively hurtful. They are described
by titles which give no real idea of their character
and composition, and they are taken by people
much to their harm.</p>

<p>'In a recent number of the <i>Lancet</i> the public
were warned against a seemingly harmless preparation,
from the effects of which a medical man
had found some of his patients seriously suffering.
He found that lozenges called "castor-oil lozenges"
were being largely used among his patients, who
were under the impression that they were taking
castor-oil in a form slightly less disagreeable than
the usual one. On examination he found that
each of these lozenges contained three grains of
calomel; and it is not a matter of astonishment
that he found some persons who had taken them
suffering from severe mercurial salivation. He
has found these lozenges sold by grocers, oilmen,
chandlers, and even by surgeons and chemists, and
the mischief done has been very great. The writer
of the letter asks whether the Adulteration Act
cannot be brought to bear upon those who sell this
"pernicious confectionery;" but the bringing an
Act to bear upon an evil is a slow process. The
true preventive of mischief from the use of quack
medicine is entire abstinence from its use.' Who
can doubt the propriety of this advice? Let quack
medicines be universally abandoned.</p>
